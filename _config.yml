Title: Welcome to Network Wizkids Technical Knowledge Base
Description: Welcome to the home of Network Wizkid.  Many of you will know me already from Twitter & YouTube however if you've not come across me before, allow me to introduce myself. The intention of my work is to educate, inspire, motivate and mentor those that have an interest in Information Technology and I also want to share what I have learnt and experienced in the field as a Consultant/Engineer. This website is intended to serve as a knowledge base for myself as well as provide useful information to those that are interested in my content. I focus predominately on Cisco security-related technologies but you can occasionally find content that stems above and beyond just that area. I hope you enjoy the content, please feel free to follow, subscribe and re-share. It is important to recognize your failures as well as your successes so that you can level-up. Kelvin 'Network Wizkid'.
